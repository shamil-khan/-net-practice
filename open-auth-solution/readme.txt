The website contains two views i.e

default.aspx
login.aspx

However, if you view default.aspx before login, it redirects to login.aspx page, where on login you will redirect to Google OpenId Authentication page.

You need to login into google website and approve our application to get email address and name, after that it will redirect you to default.aspx where it displays the information got from google.
